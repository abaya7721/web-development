  <h1> Hamburger Recipe</h1>
  <p></p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ground Beef</strong>: I prefer using 85% lean ground beef for making burger patties. It has just enough fat to keep the burgers juicy without making them overly greasy.
    <li><strong>Large Egg</strong>: This helps bind the patties together, so they hold their shape while cooking.
    <li><strong>Worcestershire Sauce:</strong> Adds a deep, savory flavor to the burgers. Just a couple of tablespoons make a big difference.
    <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> A mix of paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. These seasonings add a balance of smoky, sweet, and savory flavors to the patties.
    <li><strong>Fine Breadcrumbs:</strong> These help absorb the juices and keep the patties tender and moist. Make sure they’re finely ground for the best texture.
  </ul>
  <h4>Instructions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl add theWorcestershire sauce, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper.
    <li>Whisk well to combine.
    <li>Add the ground beef and breadcrumbs, and use your hands to mix until combined.
    <li>Portion the hamburger out into 4 equal measurements.
    <li>Gently shape the mixture into 4 patties, about ¾ inch in thickness.
    <li>Use your thumb to press down in the center of each patty to create an indent. Refrigerate the patties for 20-30 minutes to help keep their shape.
