                    <p class="content">Visiting the ghost town of Bodie, California was an amazing time. Exploring the abandoned crumbling structures
                    you could feel what was once a thriving town. This fascinating ghost town located in the Bodie Hills east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in Mono County. It was founded in 1876 after the discovery of a profitable vein of gold, which transformed it into a bustling boomtown. By 1879, Bodie had a population of nearly 10,000 people and over 2,000 buildings.
                        During its heyday, Bodie was known for its lawlessness and vice, earning the reputation of being "the wildest town in the West." The town had numerous saloons, brothels, and gambling halls. It was also one of the first towns in California to have electricity.
                        However, Bodie's prosperity was short-lived. By the 1880s, the mines began to yield less gold, and the population started to decline. The town was nearly deserted by the 1940s, and the last mine closed in 1942.</p>

                    <p class="content">There is something strange going on in Portlock. Visiting in late fall there was an eerie silence throughout the decaying buildings. Some of the building are preserved for historical significance.
                    The area has been home to the Alutiiq people for hundreds of years. The town itself, Portlock which was named after Captain Nathaniel Portlock, first formed when it was home to a cannery and then became focused on copper mining. Throughout the years there have been
                        several disappearances of the residents and possible sightings of a large create in the dense forests surrounding the coastal town. Having been abandoned since the 1950s, the town is slowly being reclaimed by the land.</p>
